[**Frontline Register Cleaner 2.0**](https://www.frontlinecleaner.com) (released in 2011) was distributed by several retailers in the UK.

We bought the code from a company in Ukraine, promoted it through the Internet and rarely updated it. It was a proprietary engine based on "RegCure" (popular product at the time).

The distribution version requires a licensing server to permit users to log in, which we've now taken down. To compensate, we've removed the registration module, allowing people to use the product for free (if they wish).

If you are interested in this type of product, we have built an [RMM (Remote Monitoring & Management)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_monitoring_and_management) tool ([FLCleaner 3.0](https://www.flcleaner.com)), which supersedes its predecessor by a significant margin. The new product is built around our experience with web centric applications ("cloud"), permitting extensibility.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

1. [VC++ Redistributable (x86)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)
2. [.NET Framework 4.8+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)

When running the app, you will need to an `x86` version of VC++ redistributable.

It does not seem to matter which version you use, as long as it is `x86` compatible. We found that without it, the app will fail citing `FLCleanEngine.dll` being unavailable.

---

#### üü¢ Github Actions

We've added a new set of build steps with Github Actions (removing the need to sign the binaries manually).

These are triggered when a `tag` is created and provide two sets of binaries for `x64` and `x86`.

The [release](https://github.com/flutils/flcleaner/releases) provides both binaries' MSI files as well as ZIP files containing the executable and DLL for x86 and x64. 

To trigger the action, a new tag needs to be pushed: -

```
git tag v2.0.0.3-alpha1
git push origin v2.0.0.3-alpha1
```

To remove the tag (locally and remote): -

```
git tag -d v2.0.0.3-alpha1
git push origin :refs/tags/v2.0.0.3-alpha1
```

The build process will sign all of the files (we keep certificate information inside the repository's secrets).
